= Grey (Yuhui) He

I am a second-year undergraduate in the #link("https://www.sps.tsinghua.edu.cn/spsen/")[School of Pharmaceutical Science] at THU (Tsinghua University). And I was also minor in Computer Science for a short time, though gave up due to the pressure and disappointment.

My personal interests include *Computer Graphics*, learning Maths and writing essays / notes / posts etc. (Definitely more in the future).

My social links:
